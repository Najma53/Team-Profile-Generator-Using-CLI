// TODO: Write Code to gather information about the development team members, and render the HTML file.
// Write code in `index.js` that uses inquirer to gather information about the development team members 
// and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes as blueprints.


// * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**’s:
// * Name
// * Employee ID
// * Email address
// * Office number




// * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
//       * Add an engineer
//       * Add an intern 
//       * Finish building the team



// * When a user selects the **engineer** option then a user is prompted to enter the 
// following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
// * Engineer's Name
// * ID
// * Email
// * GitHub username



// * When a user selects the intern option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
//       * Intern’s name
//       * ID
//       * Email
//       * School




// * When a user decides to finish building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.




// * Call the `render` function (provided for you) and pass in an array containing all employee objects; 
// * The `render` function will generate and return a block of HTML including templated divs for each employee!
